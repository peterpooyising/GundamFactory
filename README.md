# GUNDAMFACTORY

https://gundamfactory.herokuapp.com/

<strong>An ecommerce website selling Gundam models. It started off as a collaborative prototype website done in the bootcamp. I decided to create a ecommerce website using my knowledge and love for Gundam models. It comes with a customer ordering & payment functions as well as administrative functions.</strong><br>

Customers are able to search for the Gundam models according to:
- Price / Brand / Category / Name 
<p>and add them to cart. They can view their selected models' details, price, quantities and make adjustments in the cart. When they wish to checkout, they will be required to sign in with their account or via Facebook. Once they are signed in, they can proceed for payment. Transactions are tracked using Braintree.</p>
<br>

Admin is able to sign in to perform administrative functions in a seperate undisclosed URL. Admin will be able to keep track of
- Stock Count / Cost Price / Selling Price 
<p>Admin is also able to upload images of the models and customize the images shown in the website as well as perform standard CRUD operations on the models. Admin is also able to search for models using filters.</p>
